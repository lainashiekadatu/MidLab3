                The Arts and Design Strand at the University of Baguio focuses on developing the creativity, talent, and confidence of young artists who dream of making an impact through art and performance. It’s a strand for dreamers, storytellers, and visionaries — for those who believe that creativity can move people and change the world. <br>
                <br>
                In our strand, we dive into both visual and performing arts. We study design principles, stage production, theatre performance, and artistic expression. We learn how to plan, direct, and execute artistic concepts that tell meaningful stories. What makes it even more exciting is that we don’t just learn theory — we get to experience it through performances, exhibits, and collaborative projects. <br>
                <br>
                As an Arts and Design student, I’ve learned how to work with others, manage time, and think creatively even under pressure. Our projects teach us how to express emotion through color, movement, and storytelling. Theatre, in particular, taught me the value of teamwork — how every lighting cue, costume, and gesture contributes to the magic of the stage. <br>
                <br>
                Being part of this strand at the University of Baguio feels like being in a community where every student has a unique voice. Our teachers encourage us to think deeply, to experiment, and to believe in our artistic potential. This strand didn’t just teach me about art — it helped me find myself in it. <br>
