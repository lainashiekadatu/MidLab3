                    Welcome to my blog — a space where I share my creative experiences, challenges, and personal growth as a student in the Arts and Design Strand at the University of Baguio. <br>
                    <br>
                    Choosing this strand was one of the most exciting and meaningful decisions I’ve ever made. It gave me the freedom to express myself, to create without limits, and to see art not just as a subject, but as a language of emotion and imagination. Every day in this strand feels like a new opportunity to learn, perform, and create something that reflects who I am. <br>
                    <br>
                    In Arts and Design, our classroom isn’t confined by four walls — it extends to stages, studios, and even within ourselves. We work on different creative projects, from stage performances and set designs to art exhibitions and storytelling pieces. Through these activities, I’ve learned that art has the power to inspire, connect, and transform lives. <br>
                    <br>
                    This blog serves as my online journal — a place where I capture moments from rehearsals, behind-the-scenes chaos, and the quiet satisfaction that comes after every successful performance or artwork. The Arts and Design Strand continues to challenge me, but it also reminds me that creativity is limitless when you have passion and purpose. <br>
